### Voice Personality Improvements

- [ ] **Multiple emphasis markers** (`***text***` or `___text___`)
  - Currently: Not handled, reads all markup characters
  - Goal: Apply combined voice personality (bold + italic) without announcing
  - Implementation: Create or use existing combined voice personality that merges bold and italic characteristics
  - Priority: Medium
  - Notes: Deferred from initial cleanup pass to focus on voice personality system

## Future Extensions
